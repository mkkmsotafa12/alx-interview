0x0A. Prime Game
This project is part of the Alx - SE curriculum of software engineering. The 
primary goal is to implement a game where players take turns selecting prime 
numbers and removing them along with their multiples. The challenge is to 
determine the winner of each round, assuming optimal play by both players.
